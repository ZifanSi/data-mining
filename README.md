# data-mining-analyser

## Overview

**data-mining-analyser** is a research-oriented framework for implementing and comparing classical data mining algorithms.  
It focuses on **pattern mining, clustering, and classification**, and provides utilities for **data distillation** and **preprocessing** to transform raw data into processed datasets, reducing noise and improving analytical consistency.
